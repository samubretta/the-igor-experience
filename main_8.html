			<div id="intro"><h1 id="song_title">PUPPET</h1> <p>Puppet describes the lowest point in this relationship, where Tyler lost his self control and start living only for the other person and it is incapacited to react to this situation.</p> <p>Kanye's verse in the song is relevant because it isn't vocaly prominent. It's like his voice is in the back of Tyler's mind trying to helping him, as if it was his consciousness. Kanye's music has been a huge influence over Tyler's, I believe this has also to do with the metaphor between this relationship and his musical career. Kanye's role is helping him understand to be free from the pupeteer but also helping him understand the role of the old provocking Tyler in his discography.</p>

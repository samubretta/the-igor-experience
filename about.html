			<h1>WHAT IS THE IGOR EXPERIENCE?</h1>
			<p>The IGOR experience is a project developed by Samuele, an italian Communication student at the University of Bologna. The goal of this project is making you experience Tyler, The Creator's 2018 record "IGOR" in a whole new way. </p> <p>The Idea of a "listening companion" for the record comes from a poor experience trying to study in depth the project, by using multiple websites. </p> <p> That's the reason why in the page, you'll also find the Spotify player for the record. So that you can enjoy a flawless listening experience.</p> <p>Don't esitate to contact us at theigorexperience@gmail.com to ask any question or give any advice!</p> <a href="documentation.html" class="deactivated"><p >CLICK HERE FOR THE DETAILED DOCUMENTATION</p></a>
